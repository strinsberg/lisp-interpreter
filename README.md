Simple Lisp Interpreter in Racket
=================================

For a project in a programming class I wrote a simple lisp interpreter using racket.

We were allowed to define simple procedures in terms of their racket equivilents, but had to write the more complicated procedures ourselves.

We were also required to use a pure functional approach so some of the structures and functions are not the most efficient.

It was a really nice way to get an understanding of interpreters and functional programming without some of the complexities added by parsing text.

As an extra I added a simple REPL that can run the implemented subset of the language. It also allows global definitions.
